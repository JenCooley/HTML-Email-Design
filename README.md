Example of a Responsive HTML Email Design that I created through my course at Treehouse

Feel free to use this template and make it your own!

The process I used in this project was as follows:
1. Determined the purpose of the email (Newsletter)
2. Discussed the best typograhy (basic functional), images (hosted online), call to action (reason why to 'click here'), 
   max-width of 600px (many mail clients are not very wide), simplistic design (does not break)
3. We wrote the code structure using tables (for consistent structure)
   Use XHTML because gmail and outlook use it by default 
4. Added the styling (CSS2.1 INLINE CSS!) Mailchimp can insert inline CSS for you if you write it in the head
5. Added responsive media queries (adjusted width, changed font-sizes, change layout of columns)
      -"one eyeball and one thumb at arms length" is the general rule. (people generally use one hand on phone and two          on tablet)
      -16px minimum font size
      -call to action button touch targets at least 46px squared
      -avoided clustering several links together in copy to prevent accidental clicking
6. Testing - test always in outlook, yahoo, gmail, and aol
    -create template in mailchimp (create campaign)
    -choose code your own and paste in the code
    -add photes to code using file manager (images must be hosted online for email campaigns)
    -send test email to multiple accounts over various browser services
    -don't accept images permanently when checking or else it will mess up testing
    -make any changes by adding additional client specific code in the head style tags to help trouble shoot errors
